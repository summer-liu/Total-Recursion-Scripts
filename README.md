# Total-Recursion-Scripts
Total Recursion is an educational game to help students gain a deeper, conceptual understanding of recursion. The game is built using Unity3D and C#.

There are 4 levels in the game, and each level is a room with different themes about recursion.
You just need to follow the dialogue to explore the interesting facts about recursion.

The first room will show you Escher's drawing and Bach's music (get the idea from the book *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid*).
The second room will introduce you the knowledge about Fractals and the third room will present you recursion in nature.
In each room you need to solve several problems about recursion to unlock the door to next room. 
And finally when you reach the box with treasure, and unlock it by solving some difficult problems, you win!
